HackPortal
==========

It was round 2 of the web development event I held at my college fest. The participants were supposed to hack the web portal of images and videos from the source code or url

Steps to install:
1) Copy the directory HackPortal in your www directory of wamp. 
2) Goto localhost/HackPortal.
3) For logging in, enter any username password is www88.
4) Your timer would be started and Level 1 would appear.

Note: make sure you're using a HTML 5 browser as features like Localstorage have been used.
